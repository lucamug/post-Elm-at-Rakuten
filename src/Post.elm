In our team at Rakuten, we have been using Elm[^elm] in production for almost two years now. This is our story, lessons learned, likes, and dislikes.

[^elm]: **Elm** is a **compiled, immutable, strongly statically typed, purely functional** programming language that compiles to JavaScript. Javascript is a **just-in-time compiled, weakly dynamically typed, multi-paradigm** programming language. To know more about Elm, a good start is the [official guide](https://guide.elm-lang.org/). If you are familiar with JavaScript you can check [From JavaScript?](https://elm-lang.org/docs/from-javascript), a short comparison between the syntax of the two languages.

Everything started in the Berlin branch of Rakuten during the beautiful, but always too short at those latitudes, summer of 2017. We were maintaining a medium Single Page Application written in Vanilla JavaScript and things started going out of control.

> ‚ÄúWe had global variables everywhere and debugging was a nightmare‚Äù

Fixing something in one place would break the code in several other places. We had global variables everywhere and debugging was a nightmare.

We decided to auto impose some discipline and start rewriting functions in a **pure style**[^pure-style] to regain some control over our application. The code was getting better, more self-contained, simpler to reason about.

[^pure-style]: [Pure functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function) are those functions where the output only depends on the input and don‚Äôt have any side effects.

We were thinking: *‚Äúif we only could find a tool to enforce this discipline without relying on our own‚Äù*‚Ä¶ and then we came across the post **Introduction to The Elm Architecture and How to Build our First Application** published in css-tricks.com.[^css-tricks] It was love at first sight.

[^css-tricks]: The [Introduction to The Elm Architecture and How to Build our First Application](https://css-tricks.com/introduction-elm-architecture-build-first-application/) by James Kolce was the second part of a three-part series published on the [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) website in 2017.

> "Elm guarantees no errors at runtime"
>
> **-- The Elm website [^elm-website]**

[^elm-website]: The [Elm website](https://elm-lang.org/) is the main source of information and documentation to start with Elm. A quote about **runtime errors** from the site: "*Elm uses type inference to detect corner cases and give friendly hints. NoRedInk switched to Elm about two years ago, and 250k+ lines later, they still have not had to scramble to fix a confusing runtime exception in production.*" 

Elm was promising us that all the functions would be pure by design and that there would be no errors at runtime[^errors-at-runtime] anymore.

![Dynamic Typing vs. Static Typing](./images/the-elm-architecture.jpg)

[^errors-at-runtime]: In the front-end, **errors at runtime** are errors that happen in the browser. These errors can completely halt the functionality of the website and you, as creator, may not even know about them because they are happening on others‚Äô people devices. Some tools allow you to get notified when these errors happen. These errors are usually JavaScript errors, for example, trying to access values that are null or undefined. 

*Moreover, **The Elm Architecture**, included in the Elm language, seemed an excellent way to structure an application. It ended up being one of the most influential Elm ideas in the front-end world, more about this later. (Illustration by [Kolja Wilcke](https://twitter.com/01k), licensed under [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/))*

So, we started learning Elm building some prototypes and the first results were promising. But the technology stack was still heavily server-side based, mostly PHP, and the adoption was proceeding slowly.

### üïí\u{3000}One year later 

Fast forward one year (and move 10k kilometers to the left) and in the Tokyo headquarter there was an environment where Elm would have taken root easier.

Several engineers were already pushing for a more functional way of writing code and in a department heavily based on back-end APIs, there was a strong need for a decoupled way to write user interfaces.

### üïí\u{3000}Two years later 
Fast forward another couple of years and here we are, with several applications in production built-in Elm for a total of ~100k lines of code.[^oslo-elm-days]

[^oslo-elm-days]: Even if almost two years old now, some more details about the use of Elm in Rakuten can be found in my talk [Elm at large (companies)](https://youtu.be/yH6o322S8XQ) given at the **Oslo Elm Day 2019** conference.

These are some of our public projects made in Elm:

* An **authentication and registration system** used, among others, in the [Taiwanese marketplace](https://login.account.rakuten.com/sso/register?client_id=rakuten_tw01&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rakuten.com.tw%2Fmember%2Fdelegate&response_type=code&scope=openid+profile+email&ui_locales=en-UK#/registration/1), and the [Rakuten Sport website](https://login.account.rakuten.com/sso/register?client_id=rakuten_sports&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fsports.rakuten.com%2F&response_type=code&scope=openid%2Bemail%2Bprofile&ui_locales=en-UK#/sign_in).

# What we like about Elm

## 1. Controlled state

JavaScript lets us do what we want with the state of a program. This could be useful for a quick prototype, but it is a precursor of bugs because it is difficult to track what and when changed global variables.

> ‚ÄúA large fraction of the flaws in software development are due to programmers not fully understanding all the possible states their code may execute in‚Äù
>
> **-- John Carmack [^carmack-on-state]**

[^carmack-on-state]: A quote from an in-depth piece by **John Carmack** that looks at [the value of using functional-style programming with C++](https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/169296/Indepth_Functional_programming_in_C.php). John Carmack is an independent AI researcher,
consultant CTO at **Oculus VR**, and founder of **Armadillo Aerospace** and **Id Software**, where he was the lead programmer of the games **Commander Keen**, **Wolfenstein 3D**, **Doom**, and **Quake**.

All functions in Elm must be pure, so they cannot hold any state, and all data must be immutable. The entire state of your application needs to be stored in one place, by design, making your application simpler to comprehend and easier to debug.

The place where the state is, in Elm, is the `Model` and it is managed by the **Elm Runtime system**[^elm-runtime-system] so that 100% of the code that we write can be pure (these concepts will be explained in more detail later).

[^elm-runtime-system]: The [Elm runtime system](https://guide.elm-lang.org/effects/) is the part of the code in charge of directing the application. For example, it figures out how to render HTML, how to send an HTTP request, redirect users' clicks back into the Elm code, etc.  










## 2. Principle of least astonishment

One of the ideas of Elm is that the outcome of the code should be predictable, without surprises.[^POLA] These some of the concepts that may belong here:

[^POLA]: The [Principle of Least Astonishment](https://wiki.c2.com/?PrincipleOfLeastAstonishment#:~:text=The%20Principle%20of%20Least%20Astonishment,the%20operation%20and%20other%20clues.&text=In%20addition%20to%20function%20naming,applies%20to%20user%20interface%20design.) states that the result of performing some operation should be **obvious**, **consistent**, and **predictable**, based upon the name of the operation and other clues.

* The **Elm static type system**, discussed in detail below.
* The Elm Package Manager supports **Enforced Semantic Versioning**.[^semantic-versioning] No surprises in PATCH releases because version numbers are enforced by a script that scans libraries detecting, for example, removal of the renaming of exposed functions.
* **Elm-UI**, a library that we use to render views, discussed in detail later.

[^semantic-versioning]: The Elm Package Manager allows you to check differences (functions added/removed/modified) in any published Elm package just running the command `elm diff` like in `elm diff elm/json 1.0.0 1.1.2`. Evan Czaplicki gives a live example of this feature in the video [Convergent Evolution](https://youtu.be/jl1tGiUiTtI).

The **Elm static type system** is probably the attribute that most among others remove the "what?!?" moments from the experience of coding in Elm.

The Elm type system doesn‚Äôt have escape hatches, and the inference covers 100% of the code, including all external libraries.

Languages with automatic type conversion, like JavaScript, can lead to surprises.[^funny-youtube-videos] What happens if we add a number with a string, for example, `1` and `"2"`? Do we get `3`? Do we get `"12"`? Do we get an error? Do we get something else?

[^funny-youtube-videos]: There are several funny videos about this topic on Youtube. One of the most popular is probably [What the... JavaScript?](https://youtu.be/2pL28CcEijU) by Kyle Simpsons

![Dynamic Typing vs. Static Typing](./images/dynamic-vs-static-2.png)

*If you need to create a quick proof of concept, dynamic typing may be faster and the puzzle does resemble a giraffe even if it contains mistakes. But for robust applications and correct puzzle solutions, static typing is the right way to go. (Illustration by [Kolja Wilcke](https://twitter.com/01k), licensed under [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/))*

TypeScript, which adds optional static typing to JavaScript and is probably one of the best things happening to JavaScript, can partially mitigate the issues with the JavaScript dynamic type system. But being a superset of JavaScript it needs to compromise on elegance and simplicity. For example type declarations are optional (*any* as escape hatch), inference doesn‚Äôt cover all the code, it requires *type guards*[^type-guards], and not all JavaScript libraries have type annotations.



[^type-guards]: [Type guards](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html) are TypeScript expressions that perform a runtime check to discriminate *custom types*. For example:{{< highlight typescript >}}function isFish(pet: Fish | Bird): pet is Fish {
    return (pet as Fish).swim !== undefined;
}{{< /highlight >}}After that is possible to write code like:{{< highlight javascript >}}if (isFish(pet)) {
    pet.swim();
} else {
    pet.fly();
}{{< /highlight >}}In Elm *type guards* are not needed, it is possible to just use directly a [case .. of](https://guide.elm-lang.org/types/pattern_matching.html) construct{{< highlight elm >}}case pet of
    Fish fish ->
        fish.swim
    
    Bird bird ->
        bird.fly{{< /highlight >}}The **case .. of** construct also guarantees that we are considering all possible custom types.
    













## 3. ‚ÄúMaking impossible states impossible‚Äù

The depth of the Elm type system allows us to model scenarios precisely to **make impossible states impossible**.[^make-impossible-states-impossible] This is more a **coding pattern**[^coding patterns] rather than a language feature, but it requires a fully-fledged type system to be implemented.

[^make-impossible-states-impossible]: The concept of **making impossible states impossible** is well explained by [Richard Feldman in his homonymous talk at Elm-conf 2016](https://youtu.be/IcgmSRJHu_8).

[^coding patterns]: These [coding patterns in Elm](https://sporto.github.io/elm-patterns/index.html) are considered good practice. [Making impossible states impossible](https://sporto.github.io/elm-patterns/basic/impossible-states.html) is one of them.

To clarify let's make an example modeling the HTTP state with a **type alias**[^type-alias]:

[^type-alias]: A **[type alias](https://guide.elm-lang.org/types/type_aliases.html)** is a shorter name for a type. 


```elm
type alias HttpState = 
    { loading : Bool
    , error : Maybe String
    , success : Maybe String
    }
```

The **cardinality** (number of possible states) for this structure is 2 x 2 x 2 = 8 because both **Bool** and **Maybe**[^maybe] have cardinality = 2.
    
[^maybe]: **[Maybe](https://guide.elm-lang.org/error_handling/maybe.html)** is how Elm handles missing values because **null** or **undefined** don't exist. Maybe is defined as {{< highlight elm >}}type Maybe a = Just a | Nothing{{< /highlight >}}The Elm compiler will refuse to compile until you handle all the cases where a value may be missing in your code.

But the possible states of the HTTP request are only three: `Loading`, `Error`, and `Success`. To make these extra five impossible states impossible we can rewrite the code using a **custom type**[^custom-type]:

```elm
type HttpState
    = Loading
    | Error String
    | Success String
```

[^custom-type]: As Evan Czaplicki put it, ‚Äú[Custom types are the most important feature in Elm](https://guide.elm-lang.org/types/custom_types.html)‚Äù.












## 4. One way of doing things

The Elm language evolves in the direction of always finding the best solution to a problem and then enforcing the solution in the language. This guarantees consistency across codebases even if belonging to different teams and organizations.

For example:

* The adoption of The Elm Architecture as the standard way to structure web applications
* The removal of features like custom infix operator that was leading to unreadable code due to the creation of fancy non-standard operators
* The zero-configuration linter elm-format. Well, this is not strictly part of the Elm language, but it is still following this philosophy. All Elm code is formatted with the same settings. The end of the tab/space war.

Other languages and frameworks follow different principles, for example, JavaScript follows the **"One JavaScript"**[^one-javascript] meaning that the language is not versioned and is back compatible. In 25 years this inevitably accumulated a large number of different ways of doing things.

[^one-javascript]: The [One JavaScript](https://2ality.com/2014/12/one-javascript.html) principle is about removing versioning and being always back-compatible.







## 5. Stability

It is more than four years[^stability] that the language is not undergoing major updates and no foreseeable updates are coming in the future.[^roadmap] The core modules are also very stable, most of the action nowadays is happening in non-core modules and toolings.
    
[^roadmap]: [Evan Czaplicki's ideas about the future of Elm](https://discourse.elm-lang.org/t/where-can-we-find-the-roadmap-of-elm/6038).    

We started writing Elm in version 0.18 and the transition to version 0.19[^version-0-19] was very smooth. We had more issues with the update of the HTTP library from 1.0 to 2.0[^http-library-update] when, for lack of internal communication, one of our in-house dependencies was suddenly updated to HTTP 2.0 forcing us to refresh all the rest of the code in a short time.
    
[^http-library-update]: [The update of the HTTP library](https://github.com/elm/http/releases/tag/2.0.0) is probably the latest large update within the core modules.

[^version-0-19]: The [update from version 0.18 to version 0.19](https://elm-lang.org/news/small-assets-without-the-headache) was mainly about the optimization of the compiler.

[^stability]: The latest large change was the [Farewell to Functional Reactive Programming](https://elm-lang.org/news/farewell-to-frp) in May 2016. Here a [high-level picture of the updates](https://elm-lang.org/news).












## 6. Functional programming


Functional programming[^functional-programming] is coming back! Maybe we are already in the middle of a third paradigm shift.[^third-paradigm-shift]

[^functional-programming]: **Functional programming** is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions. It is a **declarative** programming paradigm based on a sequence of functions that only depend on each other in terms of arguments and return values. It looks something like this:{{< highlight text >}}func1 ( func2 ( func3 (...) ) ){{< /highlight >}}By contrast, the **procedural paradigm** is based on a sequence of **imperative** commands that may implicitly alter the shared state. It looks something like this:{{< highlight text >}}
proc() {
    proc1();
    proc2();
    proc3();
}{{< /highlight >}}

> "No matter what language you work in, programming in a functional style provides benefits. You should do it whenever it is convenient, and you should think hard about the decision when it isn't convenient."
>
> **-- John Carmack [^carmack-on-fp]**
    
[^carmack-on-fp]: [In-depth: Functional programming in C++](https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/169296/Indepth_Functional_programming_in_C.php) by John Carmack.

[^third-paradigm-shift]: [From Object Orient to Functional Programming](https://youtu.be/6YbK8o9rZfI?t=67), talk by Richard Feldman about paradigm shifts.

Functional programming is good at handling complexity with **function composition** where difficult problems are split into simpler problems and functions that solve these simpler problems are then composed together to solve the original difficult problem.







Functions obtained with this process tend to be very small. Adding the factor that functions in Elm are also pure increases reusability, maintainability, and readability of the code.
    
Recently several new functional programming languages are appearing: [Gleam](https://youtu.be/ceynSTa1dV4), [Unison](https://youtu.be/gCWtkvDQ2ZI), [Roc](https://youtu.be/ZnYa99QoznE?t=4765), [Koka](https://koka-lang.github.io/), [Formality](https://github.com/moonad/Formality). It is an exciting moment for Functional programming.













## 7. Enforced discipline

Pure functional languages motivate programmers to think better about the programs they are building. Although the initial development time can increase with such restrictions, the advantages in maintainability can compensate for the effort.

Elm enforces discipline on developers rather than letting developers be disciplined on their own. This, in conjunction with other characteristics, makes Elm a good fit for large front-end teams.
    
> ‚ÄúEverything that is syntactically legal will eventually end up in your codebase‚Äù
>
> **-- John Carmack [^carmack-on-enforced-discipline]**

[^carmack-on-enforced-discipline]: John Carmack during his [Keynote](https://youtu.be/Uooh0Y9fC_M?t=5488) at QuakeCon 2013 

Another example of enforced discipline is that it is not possible to include JavaScript code in Elm libraries.[^loophole] This means that the guarantees that Elm provides, like "no runtime errors‚Äù, apply also to all third-party libraries.

[^loophole]: A loophole that allowed using JavaScript in libraries was [closed in version 0.19](https://discourse.elm-lang.org/t/native-code-in-0-19/826).









## 8. Learnability

During its evolution, features that created confusion for beginners have been removed or modified, making it now a simple and compact language that is easy to learn.

There are several things that you **DO NOT** need to learn when you use Elm, for example, you don‚Äôt need to write JavaScript, CSS, or HTML, at least for simple applications.

Moreover, most of the tools are built-in Elm, and several other tools, necessary in a common "modern web" setup, like bundlers, linters, and web frameworks are unnecessary. This makes it simple to set up a development environment.[^built-in-tools]

[^built-in-tools]: You can start experimenting with Elm using [elm reactor](https://elmprogramming.com/elm-reactor.html), a web server built-in the Elm compiler that automatically re-compiles your code every time you refresh the browser. For more advanced coding there is [elm-live](https://github.com/wking-io/elm-live), a web server that supports custom HTML and hot reload. This is what we use for our team. You can also use the usual suspect, like Webpack or Parcel.

A beginner, by experience, can be productive in a couple of weeks and master it in a couple of months.












## 9. Compiler as assistant

The Elm compiler can statically analyze the code for inconsistencies and provide precise feedback to the programmer.[^compile-as-assistant]

[^compile-as-assistant]: The idea of the [Compiler as Assistant](https://elm-lang.org/news/compilers-as-assistants) was born together with Elm itself. In this article, Evan Czaplicki explains the further improvement in this direction done for version 0.16.

This is such an important feature that also influences a new coding style. For example, it is common while programming in Elm, to change minimal parts of the code and then let the compiler errors guide you in the rest of the task. Then rinse and repeat.[^tiny-steps]

[^tiny-steps]: [Moving Faster with Tiny Steps in Elm](https://medium.com/@dillonkearns/moving-faster-with-tiny-steps-in-elm-2e6a269e4efc) by Dillon Kearns

This is sometimes referred to as **Compiler Driven development**[^compile-driven-development] and if it involves defining type signatures first it is also referred to as **Type Driven Development**.[^type-driven-development]

[^compile-driven-development]: Kevin Yank explains what is Compiler Driven Development [in this video](https://youtu.be/kuOCx0QeQ5c?t=1402). Louis Pilfold explains [how a compiler can be an assistant during software development](https://youtu.be/ceynSTa1dV4?t=987), referring to BEAM, a language inspired by Elm. And this is yet [another sample of Compiler Driven Development](https://youtu.be/jl1tGiUiTtI?t=1219) during one of the talks of Evan Czaplicki.

[^type-driven-development]: [Idris](https://www.idris-lang.org/) is probably the fittest language for Type Drive Development. 

> ‚ÄúIf it compiles, it works‚Äù **[^if-it-compiles-it-works]**
    
[^if-it-compiles-it-works]: This way of saying probably [originated in Haskell](https://wiki.haskell.org/Why_Haskell_just_works) but it applies to Elm too.

The compiler guarantees that all edge cases are covered, something difficult to achieve with hand-made unit tests. Another advantage of the compiler static analysis is that it is extremely fast and can provide the exact location of errors.

![John Carmack on Elm Errors](./images/john-carmack-on-errors-1.png)

*The Elm compiler produces **state-of-the-art error messages** and their good quality is now an inspiration for other language designers too.[^error-messages]*
    
[^error-messages]: "[This should be an inspiration for every error message](https://twitter.com/id_aa_carmack/status/735197548034412546)", John Carmack commenting on Elm error messages













## 10. Elm as an influencer

Most technologies get influenced by existing ideas in a way or another. Elm, for example, has been influenced by Haskell, Standard ML, OCaml, and F#.

On the other side, Elm is having an impact on the front-end community and the programming industry in general, thanks to its innovative ideas.

For example:

* Redux, the React state management system, was inspired by The Elm Architecture.[^redux-prior-art]

* These are other UI frameworks and libraries inspired by The Elm Architecture: [Elmish](https://elmish.github.io/elmish/) | [Hydux](https://github.com/hydux/hydux) | [Hyperapp](https://hyperapp.dev/) | [DvaJS](https://dvajs.com/) | [Iced](https://github.com/hecrj/iced) | [Miso](https://haskell-miso.org/) | [Realm](https://github.com/antoyo/relm) | [Yew](https://crates.io/crates/yew/0.1.0) | [Bolero](https://fsbolero.io/) | [Bucklescript-tea](https://github.com/OvermindDL1/bucklescript-tea) | [Fabulous](https://fsprojects.github.io/Fabulous/) | [Selm](https://github.com/rizumita/Selm) | [SwiftElm](https://github.com/inamiy/SwiftElm) | [Tea-in-swift](https://github.com/chriseidhof/tea-in-swift) | [Portal](https://github.com/guidomb/Portal)  | [Swift-elm](https://github.com/momentumworks/swift-elm) | [Harvest](https://github.com/inamiy/Harvest) | [Functional-frontend-architecture](https://github.com/paldepind/functional-frontend-architecture) |  [Willow](https://github.com/sindreij/willow) | [Seed](https://github.com/seed-rs/seed).     
    
* There are also several programming languages influenced by Elm: [Roc](https://youtu.be/ZnYa99QoznE?t=4792) | [Gleam](https://youtu.be/ceynSTa1dV4) | [Dark](https://darklang.com/).

* The quality of errors of the Elm compiler propelled efforts by several languages to improve their own error messages system.

[^redux-prior-art]: The [Prior Art](https://redux.js.org/understanding/history-and-design/prior-art) document of **Redux** explains in detail the Elm influence.

We now use Elm because we believe it is the best option to build front-end, and the number of tools inspired by it is a testimony of its qualities, but we are keeping an eye on what is happening in the field and we are not concerned to switch if something better becomes available.

Considering how influential Elm is and the general trend toward Functional Programming, it seems that this ‚Äúsomething better‚Äù is going to happen in the same direction where Elm is going so it will not be a dramatic switch.

I am personally intrigued by [Unison](https://www.unisonweb.org/) lately. It is a very innovative language and it has a quite appropriate tagline: *‚ÄúA friendly programming language from the future‚Äù*.
    










## 11. The Elm Architecture

This is probably the most relevant and influential innovation of Elm.[^the-elm-architecture] It is a **unidirectional data flow**[^unidirectional-data-flow] that helps to keep your application well organized. Also, it helps to quickly understand applications built by other developers as this is the standard way to build applications in Elm.    
    
[^the-elm-architecture]: Details about The Elm Architecture can be found in the [official Elm Guide](https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/). The Elm Architecture is the predominant way to build applications in Elm. Different variants are also possible. [Elm-spa](https://www.elm-spa.dev/guide) by Ryan Haskell-Glatz is a tool that helps to create Single Page Applications and create extra abstraction above The Elm Architecture. R√©mi Lef√®vre built the [RealWorld example app](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) using the [Effect pattern](https://discourse.elm-lang.org/t/realworld-example-app-architected-with-the-effect-pattern/5753).
        
[^unidirectional-data-flow]: The Elm Architecture is based on [**unidirectional data flow**](https://youtu.be/jl1tGiUiTtI?t=470) (a.k.a. **one-way data binding**) like React, in contrast to the **bidirectional data flow** (a.k.a. **two-way data binding**) of frameworks like Angular, Vue, and Svelte ([in Svelte two-way binding can be disabled](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/issues/54)). There have been issues with two-way data binding. For example, the many-to-many dependencies between the view and the model can create an infinite loop of cascading updates. Another issue is the lack of control of the change detection mechanism. It is an implicit behavior that is not easy to control. Unidirectional data flow tends to be more predictable.

*A simple representation of the unidirectional data flows in The Elm Architecture. (Source: The Elm Guide)*[^representation-of-unidirectional-flow]
    
[^representation-of-unidirectional-flow]: The illustration **A simple representation of the Elm Architecture** is from the as depicted in the [Elm Guide](https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/) used under the [CC BY-NC-ND 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/) [license](https://github.com/evancz/guide.elm-lang.org/blob/master/LICENSE).
    
There are three building blocks in The Elm Architecture:
    
* `Model` --- the state of your application, the only thing that can mutate
* `view` --- a way to turn your state into HTML
* `update` --- a way to update your state based on Model and messages
        
If we zoom in on the `Elm` block in the diagram above, this is what is happening inside:        

![The Elm Architecture, animated](./images/the-elm-architecture-animation.gif)

This animation shows in detail how the **Elm runtime system**[^elm-runtime] orchestrates the **infinite loop**[^the-game-loop] of an Elm application. 
    
[^elm-runtime]: When we write Elm code, 100% of our code is pure so there are no side effects. But without side effects, our application will be just a boring silent empty screen. The **Elm runtime system** is the part of the code that is in charge of the side-effects. In our code, we just request these side effects to be done and we wait for the outcomes. Examples of side effects are HTTP requests or DOM modifications. How to do side effects while remaining pure? In Elm there are two ways. For things like HTTP requests, for example, there are commands (`Cmd`), that are instructions, in the form of data, that we request sending them to he Elm runtime system. For changing the DOM, the way to do side effect is to take the entire state of the world as argument and returning a new version of it. So we are able to change the world (side effect) still remaining pure. The world in our case is the **Model** and the function that does that is the **update** function: `update: Msg -> Model -> (Model, Cmd msg)` (see [The Elm Architecture]({{< ref "#11-the-elm-architecture" >}}) for more details). The video [What is IO monad?](https://youtu.be/fCoQb-zqYDI?t=42) by Alexey Kutepov explains this concept in general terms.
    
[^the-game-loop]: If you are familiar with game development you can find similarities between **The Elm Architecture** and **The Game Loop**. The main difference is that usually games don't wait for something to happen, but the loop keeps running all the time. When we develop games in Elm, we do the same using [onAnimationFrame](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/browser/latest/Browser-Events#onAnimationFrame) so that the loop keeps running with a usual speed of 60 times per second.

The **Elm runtime system**:

* Waits for something to happen, for example, "a button is pressed"
* Converts the event into the appropriate message `Msg`
* Sends `Msg` and `Model` to `update` that will return an updated `Model` and optional commands `Cmd`, for example, an HTTP request
* Sends `Cmd`, if any, to the *effects engine*
* Sends the updated `Model` to `view` that will return new HTML
* Updates the DOM using the new HTML
* GOTO start
    
    
    









## 12. The Elm debugger

The built-in **Elm debugger**[^elm-debugger] is a very useful tool to debug an Elm application. It shows the state of your application and keeps track of all messages that have been fired giving you the ability to go back in time.[^elm-debugger-example]
    
    
[^elm-debugger]: More about the **Elm debugger** in [The Perfect Bug Report](https://elm-lang.org/news/the-perfect-bug-report)
    
[^elm-debugger-example]: The **Elm debugger** is usually disabled for applications that are released in production, but you can find an example of it in [elmjapan.org](https://elmjapan.org/) where it has been kept active for educational purposes.

![The Elm Debugger](./images/debugger.gif)















## 13. Elm-UI, the alternative to CSS/HTML

**Elm-UI** is **a new language for layout and interface**[^elm-ui] made by 
Matthew Griffith that is a complete alternative to HTML and CSS. It is the most used non-core Elm library and we use it in almost all of our projects.[^popular-packages]
    
[^elm-ui]: More information about **Elm-UI** in [the module documentation](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/mdgriffith/elm-ui/latest/).
    
[^popular-packages]: This [enhanced mirror of the Elm Package Manager](https://elm.dmy.fr/) list packages in order of popularity. If we exclude the core library, the top 5 packages are: [Elm-UI](https://elm.dmy.fr/packages/mdgriffith/elm-ui/latest/) | [elm-json-decode-pipeline](https://elm.dmy.fr/packages/NoRedInk/elm-json-decode-pipeline/latest/) | [elm-css](https://elm.dmy.fr/packages/rtfeldman/elm-css/latest/) | [elm-color](https://elm.dmy.fr/packages/avh4/elm-color/latest/) | [remotedata](https://elm.dmy.fr/packages/krisajenkins/remotedata/latest/).
    
It applies the **Principle of Least Astonishment** seen earlier to the design of a web page. Your intents are properly translated in the design, something that rarely happens using CSS. This makes the design process fun and quick.
    
This sounds like magic, how is it possible? Let's briefly see what Elm-UI is doing behind the scenes.
    
In a regular Elm application, you would write your view using Elm functions. Note that Elm doesn't have a separate templating language, **the templating language for Elm is Elm**.[^templating-language]
    
[^templating-language]: Evan Czaplicki mentions that **the templating language for Elm is Elm** in the video [Convergent Evolution](https://youtu.be/jl1tGiUiTtI?t=371) that compares Elm to React.    
    
For example this block of Elm code[^html-in-elm]

[^html-in-elm]: Note that `div`, `p`, and `img` are all functions that accept two lists, one for attributes and one for children elements. `text` and `src` are also functions. It may help to see the type signature of these functions to understand better: {{< highlight elm >}}div  : List (Attribute msg) -> List (Html msg) -> Html msg
p    : List (Attribute msg) -> List (Html msg) -> Html msg
img  : List (Attribute msg) -> List (Html msg) -> Html msg
text : String -> Html msg
src  : String -> Attribute msg{{< /highlight >}}
    

```elm
div []
    [ p [] [ text "Hi there!" ]
    , img [ src "photo.jpg" ] []
    ]
```

generates this HTML

```html
<div>
    <p>Hi there!</p>
    <img src="photo.jpg">
</div>
```

There is a one-to-one relationship between these two representations. So nothing special here.
    
Using **Elm-UI** you would write instead

```elm
column []
    [ paragraph [] [ text "Hi there!" ]
    , image []
        { src = "photo.jpg"
        , description = "Image description"
        }
    ]
```

And this will programmatically generate the following HTML (and CSS, omitted for brevity).[^elm-ui-example]

[^elm-ui-example]: You can check the entire outcome of **Elm-UI** in this [live example](https://ellie-app.com/bWJZwXdFvtWa1).

```html
<div class="hc s c wc ct cl">
    <div class="spacing-5-5 s p wf">
        <div class="s t wc hc">Hi there!</div>
    </div>
    <div class="s e ic">
        <img class="s e" src="photo.jpg" alt="Image description">
    </div>
</div>
```    

**Elm-UI** did all the heavy lifting for us adding a bunch of styling and elements to assure that the page looks exactly the way we meant (maybe not relevant in this trivial example but very important for complex layouts). There are new semantic concepts, like `column` that don't exist in HTML. Also **Elm-UI** assure that our HTML is valid and accessible forcing us to add a description to the image and blocking us from adding children to the `img` element.[^no-children-image]
    
[^no-children-image]: We cannot add children to the HTML element `img` due to the definition of `image` itself{{< highlight elm >}}image :
    List (Attribute msg)
    -> { src : String, description : String }
    -> Element msg{{< /highlight >}}As you can see, differently from `img`, that was defined as{{< highlight elm >}}img : 
    List (Attribute msg)
    -> List (Html msg) 
    -> Html msg{{< /highlight >}}`image` does accept only one list, the attributes, but not a second list of children.

A breath of fresh air after years spent learning all sort of CSS tricks.[^css-tricks-irony]
    
[^css-tricks-irony]: Before moving to **Elm-UI** we were avid consumers of [css-tricks.com](https://css-tricks.com/), an excellent source of CSS tricks and web-development related information. Ironically it was also the place where we learned the existence of Elm that led us to use **Elm-UI** and eventually made **css-tricks.com** way less relevant.
    
     











## 14. Readability and Elm syntax

Functional languages, being declarative, allow us to concentrate on writing *what* and not *how*. Hiding the ‚Äúhow‚Äù details make the code easier to read and understand, the ‚Äúintentions‚Äù of the code became transparent. In the Elm community readability of the code is always taken into high consideration because as developers we spend more time reading code than writing code.
    
Elm has an ML-style syntax in contrast to the C-style syntax of Java, JavaScript, and other popular languages. It was a choice that traded familiarity with convenience and fitness,[^ml-style] as sometimes *familiarity hides complexity*.[^familiarity-hides-complexity]

[^familiarity-hides-complexity]: [Are we there yet?](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Are-We-There-Yet-Rich-Hickey/) 11mins.
    
[^ml-style]: Evan Czaplicki explains about the decision of ML-style syntax throughout the video [Convergent Evolution](https://youtu.be/jl1tGiUiTtI?t=384).
    
What we like about this syntax is its simplicity, most parentheses, keywords, and punctuations are removed. This is how we define `add`, a function that adds two numbers together:[^function-definitions]
    
[^function-definitions]: Elm supports currying, so it converts a function that takes multiple arguments into a sequence of functions that each take a single argument:{{< highlight elm >}}
add a b = a + b -- <function> : number -> number -> number
add 1           -- <function> : number -> number
add 1 2         -- 3 : number{{< /highlight >}}The closest analogue in Javascript is {{< highlight javascript >}}
add = a => b => a + b // a => b => a + b
add(1)                // b => a + b
add(1)(2)             // 3
{{< /highlight >}}That is mostly syntactic sugar for{{< highlight javascript >}}function add(a) {
    return function(b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}{{< /highlight >}}

    
```elm
add a b = a + b
```
### Pipe operator

We like the pipe operator also presents in other languages like Elixir and F#. It can help to deal with multiple parentheses or with data flows. Let's consider this snippet that calls four nested functions:
    
```elm
f ( g ( h ( i 7 ) ) )
```

It can be re-written with the pipe operator as

```elm
f <| g <| h <| i 7
```

The benefit is that we don't need the close (and count) parenthesis anymore. With a reversed pipe we can rewrite in a different style so to make the data flow more explicit:
    
```elm
7
    |> i
    |> h
    |> g
    |> f
```

### Pattern matching

An example of pattern matching is the `case .. of` that allows us to branch based on the **custom type** variant. For example:
    
```elm
type Color = Red | Green | Blue

hex color = 
    case color of
        Red   -> "ff0000"
        Green -> "00ff00"
        Blue  -> "0000ff"        
```        

In case we add a fourth variant to the color type, the compiler will force us to add that case to this construct, very useful.















## 15. Refactoring

The fact that the Elm compiler is like an assistant and that once it compiles, it usually works makes refactoring a pleasant experience.

An additional factor that makes refactoring easy is that being a purely functional language, it doesn‚Äôt matter in which order we write the code.[^order-doesnt-matter] For example in Elm we can write:[^order-doesnt-matter-ellie]
    
[^order-doesnt-matter]: Elm also doesn't have [hoisting](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Hoisting), the JavaScript mechanism where variable and function declarations are put into memory during the compile phase giving the impression that they are moved to the top of their scope before code execution.

```elm
b = a + 2
a = 1
```

[^order-doesnt-matter-ellie]: [Live example in Elm](https://ellie-app.com/bS3bK8gnW8na1)


Even if the two lines seem in the wrong order, it is correct Elm code, but the same code will throw the error ‚Äú`b` is not defined‚Äù in imperative languages.[^order-doesnt-matter-jsfiddle]
        
[^order-doesnt-matter-jsfiddle]: [Live example in JavaScript](https://jsfiddle.net/xsbhLm9z/)

Because the order doesn‚Äôt matter, we can shuffle pieces of code around making the refactoring simpler.

In our largest project, we are in the middle of a third major refactoring iteration and we have pieces of code that are still at the first iteration and some code as the second iteration. And they are all working well together. We are now incrementally moving all our code toward the third iteration. In Elm, you don't need to get things right from the beginning.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
## 16. Hiring

Hiring for a language that is not mainstream has some downside, for example, not many developers are already fluent in it.

But at present, there are probably more developers that know Elm compared to the number of available job positions so it is not difficult to find Elm developers. Besides, engineers that know Elm do it out of their passion and probably have a good and wide knowledge of other technologies too.

In any case, learning Elm is a fast process. As already stated, our experience is that it takes a couple of weeks to be productive and a couple of months to master it. So instead of focusing exclusively on engineers that already know Elm we can simply focus on engineers with open minds and curiosity to learn new things.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
## 17. Fast performance and small assets

Being a purely functional language, a lot of optimization can be done in Elm. This lead to several benefits including:

* The performances of Elm applications are among the fastest. Elm uses a virtual DOM, similar to React, but its performances are similar to Svelte that has optimized code to change the DOM directly.[^performances]
* Elm has smaller assets, compared to other frameworks. Among the several optimizations to achieve this result, there is the **dead code elimination** with granularity to the single function that works across the entire ecosystem. You can import massive packages and use only one function without problem as only that function will end up in your generated code.[^tree-shaking]

[^performances]: Elm and Svelte are [neck and neck](https://twitter.com/sveltejs/status/1138094066867089408) as it can be verified from the [JavaScript framework benchmark](https://github.com/krausest/js-framework-benchmark). [This thread](https://discourse.elm-lang.org/t/can-the-compiler-skip-virtual-dom/6300) has an interesting conversation about web frameworks performances.

[^tree-shaking]: The equivalent of **dead code elimination**, in JavaScript, is called [tree shaking](https://webpack.js.org/guides/tree-shaking/) and it usually works at the granularity of modules instead of single functions. [Other optimizations contribute to the small assets of Elm](https://elm-lang.org/news/small-assets-without-the-headache). Our largest application of ~66,500 lines of Elm code is 188kb zipped, including the SVG assets, the extra Javascript, and translations in several languages.
    
Not related to the application performance but still related to performance in general: the Elm compiler is very fast. Our largest codebase that is ~66,500 lines of code compiles incrementally in 0.3 seconds and from scratch in 2.5 seconds.[^compiler-performances]

[^compiler-performances]: These numbers are calculated [using this method](https://discourse.elm-lang.org/t/help-gather-data-on-build-times/4624) on a MacBook Pro 2.3GHz Quad-Core i7.











# What we don't like about Elm

## 1. Not mainstream

![Escape](./images/escape2.jpg)
*If many people believe something, does it make it true? [^appeal-to=popularity]*
    
[^appeal-to=popularity]: Appeal to popularity, or [Argumentum ad populum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum), is a fallacious argument that concludes that something must be true because many or most people believe it. The illustration is [made with Elm](https://ellie-app.com/bY2R6xF5mWda1).

It is difficult to promote the adoption of Elm in environments where the fallacious argument of "appeal to popularity" can be used by decision-makers.
    
This is a common problem with all technologies that are not mainstream, something that goes along the line "The technology X is better than Y because it has more stars in Github".[^what-is-success]

[^what-is-success]: Evan Czaplicki in the talk [What is Success?](https://youtu.be/uGlzRt-FYto?t=261) discuss this topic.

We believe that arguments should be considered case by case. Sometimes not being mainstream do has related implications (see [Reinventing the wheel]({{< ref "#3-reinventing-the-wheel" >}})), other times it is more nuanced than it seems (see [Hiring]({{< ref "#16-hiring" >}})), most of the times not being mainstream is unrelated to good qualities.[^oop] 
    
[^oop]: For example, did the object-oriented paradigm become mainstream for its inherently good qualities to deal with complex problems, as it was originally intended? Was it by chance? (As Richard Feldman suggests in his video [Why Isn't Functional Programming the Norm?](https://youtu.be/QyJZzq0v7Z4?t=2069)) Was it because it is a bad paradigm (as Brian Will highlights in [Object-Oriented Programming is Bad](https://youtu.be/QM1iUe6IofM)) but Microsoft and the industry promoted it?
    
Regardless of the popularity of Elm, many companies are using it, including several large companies like Microsoft, IBM, eBay, Ford, Amazon, Zalando, and Thoughtbot.[^elm-usage]

[^elm-usage]: Some of these companies are mentioned by Richard Feldman in the video [Building UIs in the Dark (aka Elm Programming)](https://youtu.be/sKxEwjKQ5zg?t=303) and the list [Elm companies](https://github.com/jah2488/elm-companies).
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
## 2. Lack of googleable resources

Asking an Elm question in Google does not always give good results. Most of the Elm conversation within the Elm community is happening in Slack channel[^slack] that is not visible to the Google bots.

[^slack]: The [Elm Slack channel](https://elmlang.herokuapp.com/) counts around 20,000 members. Another platform used by the Elm community is [discourse.elm-lang.org](https://discourse.elm-lang.org/).
    
Also, another consequence is that the quantity of material on Stack Overflow is limited. This is not always as bad as it seems, as Stack Overflow sometimes suffer from having information that is not updated and can even be not only useless but even harmful
    
In Slack things are always fresh and the community is very supportive. It is just not visible and it requires an extra effort to join the Slack channel.















## 3. Reinventing the wheel

Not being a mainstream language, sometimes it is necessary to reinvent something that maybe was already available by adopting another technology. For example, we wrote a library inspired by *react-jsonschema-form* to create HTML forms.[^r10-form-library 
    
[^r10-form-library: The library that we wrote is now [open source](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/rakutentech/r10/latest/R10-Form).

This issue was more significant in the past, the number of Elm packages covers a wide spectrum of subjects nowadays.
    
    















## 4. Mindset shift

Purely functional programming could be somehow mind-bending and intimidating for a developer that programmed only in an object-oriented style. 
    
Some consider this a benefit as it brings you out of your comfort zone and makes you think differently about programming.

But for someone else is a burden and could discourage a team from adopting Elm. 






















## 5. Content-driven static websites


Elm is not a good fit to build static websites that are mostly content-driven. In these cases, a good old server-side rendered website can be a better option.
    
On the other side, if you get to like Elm, it is hard to go back to plain JavaScript/HTML/CSS so we experimented with Elm also for static websites. There are several tools for static site generation, we used *elm-starter*[^elm-starter], a library that transforms an Elm website in a PWA that is also installable, works off-line, and also works without Javascript.
    
[^elm-starter]: These are the most common tools that can be used to generate static sites in Elm: [elm-pages](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/dillonkearns/elm-pages/latest/) | [elmstatic](https://github.com/alexkorban/elmstatic) | [elm-starter](https://github.com/lucamug/elm-starter).

*elm-starter* pre-render pages at build time, making it a good candidate also for SEO. The results so far are not bad and the Lighthouse scores are promising.
    














## 6. Some JavaScript and CSS are still necessary

Ideally, we could build an application just writing Elm language but if you need to use a third-party library that is not converted to Elm, we still need to use Javascript. This means re-entering the realm of possible runtime errors.
        
Elm provides several three ways to interact with external libraries: Flags, Ports, and Custom Elements.[^interop] All of them require you to write some Javascript.
    
In our case, for example, we must use a Javascript library for handling the payments.
    
The required CSS, in case you use **Elm-UI**, is very limited. In our applications, we just have small snippets of CSS that are mainly tricks to support IE11.
    
Related to this, Elm is probably not a good fit for very short projects that require lots of integration with third-party JavaScript libraries.
    
[^interop]: Elm provides several methodologies to communicate with Javascript. This is [an introduction to Javascript interoperability](https://guide.elm-lang.org/interop/) with some [implementation examples](https://github.com/elm-community/js-integration-examples).



















# Conclusion

We mentioned some of the benefits of coding with Elm, or with a purely functional language for that matter, and some of the issues.
    
For us, the benefits are overwhelming the majority, compared to the issues, and this is why we are happy with the choice that we made.

> ‚ÄúThen I came to Functional Programming ‚Ä¶ and programming was fun again!"
>
> **R√∫nar Bjarnason[^fp-fun-again]**

Regardless of the technical benefits, is this feeling of relaxation, of not being left alone, of not being afraid of breaking things that is the main value of coding with Elm.
    
Compared to the pre-Elm experience, coding is now more enjoyable and more productive! üéâ
